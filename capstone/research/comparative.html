    <p>I like the whole overlay of the website. I think it is pretty good design. However, I feel like the interface would be done better. So I want to learn from it's waiting page, or the page that I captured and make the interface of to show the explanation better for easier understanding.</p>

    <h2>Benaki Museum</h2>

    <p>I really like the little "map" that is on the left bottom. I think it is important to help people to know the overall view when they are focusing on details. I think it is really helpful to have something similar to it so that people would know better which session they have watched and where it is beting located on the seal. I would like some highlights like it to help the overall performance of the page.</p>
